Net-SNMP-Util

The Module C<Net::SNMP::Util> gives you functions of SNMP getting operation
interfaces using Net::SNMP.

Module Net::SNMP is a great module. That it's OO, having non-blocking mode and
convenient callback, flexible to implement for any aspects. Though that, I
wanted function to access several hosts at the same time and treat responses
data with common and simple way.

This is a reason why I made this module.
Have an ease way to watch traffics or health of devices on your networks!!
